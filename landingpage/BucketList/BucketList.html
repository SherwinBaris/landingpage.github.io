	<h2>Here is my Bucket List that I wanted to achieve during my college and after my college years. :
	<ul>
		<li>Graduate - I dont care about how my grades looks as long as I know to myself that I did my best. 
			I just want to finish my college and graduate so I can help my parents financially.</li>
		<li>Personal Growth - Since College is a stressful year I need to set goals for myself to improve my time management, 
			develop better study habits, and overcome challenges like stress.</li>
		<li>Community Development - As a college student I need to get involve more in campus curricular activities and engage into volunteer works.
			I need to be in a club or organizations that fits with my interests.</li>
		<li>Explore - College is like a time for me to explore new ideas, perspectives. Either learning a new languages or participating to a events 
			that doesnt really amaze me. Just to broaden and enlighten my understanding to the world I live.</li>
		<li>Explore the World - As soon as I get financially stable or atleast can live without a problem. I would travel every country and explore new things.</li>
	</ul>
Overall my bucket list is the achievements and goals I set myself that should aspire me to achieve them during in school. And inspire me during hard times. 
Having this is very important to show my interests and passion and shows my dedication. </h2>
